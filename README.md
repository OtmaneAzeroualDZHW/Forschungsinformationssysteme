Measurement of data quality in research information systems (RIS)

So far, no data quality measurements have been programmed with Python to assess the quality of metadata from scientific publications in CRIS. With this in mind, I programmed the methods and algorithms as code to measure the quality in terms of objective data quality dimensions such as completeness, correctness, consistency and timeliness. This was prepared as a macro service so that users can use the measurement results with the program code to make a statement about the metadata of their scientific publications, so that management can rely on high-quality data when making decisions.
